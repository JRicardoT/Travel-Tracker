# ExploreX - Travel Tracker

#### A Front End Development Project by:
- [Ricardo Tovar](https://github.com/JRicardoT)

#### Project Manager : Nik Seif 

### Description
This application is the start of a travel tracker application. Once the application loads, you as a user will be prompted to fill up a login form. Upon successful login you will be taken to your dashboard where you'll see all of your trips, a greeting, and the total amount you've spent in trips this year. In your dashboard you will be able to book a new trip by entering a date, destination, duration of trip, and number of travelers. Once your trip is booked, it will show up in your pending trips.

### Goals
The goals of this project were to:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code.
- Work with an API to send and receive data.
- Solidify the code review process.
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Running ExploreX
- `git clone` the repo down to your machine.
- `cd` into the repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- `git clone` the API repository needed [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api).
- `cd` into the repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- Check both are running in your local machine. 
- Go back to your browser and enter https://localhost:8080 in the search bar to access the frontend of the application.

### Challenges
- Timing Asynchronous Javascript.

 ### Wins!
 - Being able to implement Fetch requests to POST and GET data.
 - Building out class and test structures.
 - Creating all separte files for API calls, DOM manipulation.
 - Implementing Asynchronous JavaScript.

### Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- HTML
- SCSS/Sass
- Mocha & Chai
- Local API
- Node.js & NPM
- Webpack

### Future Goals
- DRY up some of the Javascript
- Optimize code for faster load times and performance
- Check some elements of accessibility, including testing with a screenreader
- Flesh out sad path testing
- Add a logout feature
